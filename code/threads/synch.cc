/// Routines for synchronizing threads.
///
/// Three kinds of synchronization routines are defined here: semaphores,
/// locks and condition variables (the implementation of the last two are
/// left to the reader).
///
/// Any implementation of a synchronization routine needs some primitive
/// atomic operation.  We assume Nachos is running on a uniprocessor, and
/// thus atomicity can be provided by turning off interrupts.  While
/// interrupts are disabled, no context switch can occur, and thus the
/// current thread is guaranteed to hold the CPU throughout, until interrupts
/// are reenabled.
///
/// Because some of these routines might be called with interrupts already
/// disabled (`Semaphore::V` for one), instead of turning on interrupts at
/// the end of the atomic operation, we always simply re-set the interrupt
/// state back to its original value (whether that be disabled or enabled).
